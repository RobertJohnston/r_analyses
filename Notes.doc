What is .md ? 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md.Like other markup languages like HTML and Latex, it is completely independent from R.

What is .rmd ? 
R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code. 
.Rmd files can be knitted as HTML, with the R code run and output produced. 

What is .YAML ? 
The YAML metadata seen at the top of RMarkdown files is specifically to pass options to rmarkdown::render, to guide the build process.

What is .Rproj ?
When a new project is created RStudio: Creates a project file (with an . Rproj extension) within the project directory. This file contains various project options and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the filesystem

The magical process that turns your R Markdown to HTML is like so:
foo.Rmd --> foo.md --> foo.html

In many cases, you only want the markdown. In that case, we switch the output format to github_document. This means rendering look like this: foo.Rmd --> foo.md where foo.md is GitHub-flavored markdown. 

If you still want the HTML but also the intermediate markdown, add to YAML to the top of the .Rmd file

Transform the R markdown to R:

    Anything that’s not R code? Like the YAML and the prose? Protect it with roxygen-style comments: start each line with #'.

    Anything that is R code? Let it exist “as is” as top-level code. That means you’ll need to change the syntax of R chunk headers like so:

    Before: ```{r setup, include = FALSE}
    After: #+ r setup, include = FALSE

    Replace the leading backticks and opening curly brace with #+.
    Delete the trailing curly brace.
    Delete the 3 backticks that end each chunk.

Render the R script through one of these methods:

    Click on the “notebook” icon in RStudio to “Compile Report”.
    In RStudio, do File > Knit Document.
    In R, do rmarkdown::render("foo.R").

You’ll get a markdown and/or HTML report, just as with R Markdown.
