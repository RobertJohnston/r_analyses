Production of code for R and RStudio

What is .md ? 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md.Like other markup languages like HTML and Latex, it is completely independent from R.

What is .rmd ? 
R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code. 
.Rmd files can be knitted as HTML, with the R code run and output produced. 

What is .YAML ? 
The YAML metadata seen at the top of RMarkdown files is specifically to pass options to rmarkdown::render, to guide the build process.

What is .Rproj ?

Create a repository on GitHub

The magical process that turns your R Markdown to HTML is like so:
foo.Rmd --> foo.md --> foo.html

In many cases, you only want the markdown. In that case, we switch the output format to github_document. This means rendering look like this: foo.Rmd --> foo.md where foo.md is GitHub-flavored markdown. 

If you still want the HTML but also the intermediate markdown, add to YAML
