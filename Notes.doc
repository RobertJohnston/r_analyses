Production of code for R and RStudio

What is .md ? 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md.Like other markup languages like HTML and Latex, it is completely independent from R.
.md files can be previewed as HTML, but the R code is not run. 

What is .rmd ? 
R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code. 
.Rmd files can be knitted as HTML, with the R code run and output produced. 

What is .YAML ? 
The YAML metadata seen at the top of RMarkdown files is specifically to pass options to rmarkdown::render, to guide the build process.

What is .Rproj ?
